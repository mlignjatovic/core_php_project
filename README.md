Assignment for IT-Academy, PHP Development. I build a simple routing system for this project and I used MVC pattern.Classes, that are manipulating on database data are clearly separated from classes that take data from a database. I used Views as a logic behind UI. Templates are actually in /Ui folder. A user can simply add routes in routes.php file. Admin user has the rights to insert new posts, delete posts, edit posts, delete comments from other users. Admin user can also add other admin users. When ordinary user register he can add comments and he has a dashboard where he can see all his comments and delete them.
